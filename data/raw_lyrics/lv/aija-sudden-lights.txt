# Aijā — Sudden Lights

You said some words
Didn't hear you fall asleep
People were talking louder
From my TV screen

I heard them scream
It was too dark to see

Don't cry
I'll try to
Say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

You still think we live in a world so beautiful
You see, I think I don't believe
In this stuff anymore

Don't cry
I'll try to
Say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

Don't cry
I'll try to
Say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please, don't wake up
Wake up

(Please, don't make me wake)
(Don't make me wake)
Please! (Don't make me wake)
Don't wake up (don't make me wake)
Wake up!

Aijā, aijā
Saldā miegā
Aijā, aijā
Saldā miegā
